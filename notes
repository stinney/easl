AN missing variant2

DUG~a missing variant1

DUG~b×U₂ broken image (bad o-number in thumbs; 451 should be 450)

DUG~b×U₂ has 2 glyfs in EASL but 3 in PCSL

DUG~d needs fixed

EŠ₂? EASL0309 / 12B5B no glyf in EASL; ŠE₃ sorts as ŠE₃ but ŠE₃@t sorts as EŠ₂@t

Make Blobs Great Again: BAN, MUŠ₃, KUR~c, NUN~c

DIB glyphs are all queried; irl DIB at JN / Uruk III may be more like a regular square LAGAB×PA

DUG~b×U₂ RG is not in EASL but does occur in Uruk III

KUR~c triangles version: does this occur in Uruk IV/III? Seems not to ...

KUR~c~v1 o0901161 needs redesigned char; see copy in P000590

ŠEN~d -- what's up with this?

BAPPIR~e == ŠIM(@g)×GAR?

EZEN~c/EZEN~b@t same--which is used in corpus?

EASL508 F2DF1 no character display

KITI not sequence? because X+pole-with-streamers = KALAM~a..f; KITI BU~b+KALAM~a or BU~b+KALAM~b

LAGAB~a×2(N14) unify with Uruk IV EZEN~a?? Orientation different?

NESAG~a not in NC-table; is one of them edur only?

what was the NIM~b1 compound that I didn't tag as a compound?

NINDA₂×GUDU₄ reorg to get all vars into EASL0921

NU@g is LAK121 BAR×TAB-ish

NUMUN₂ is quasi-|ZI&ZI|
