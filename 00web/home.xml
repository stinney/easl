  <esp:title>Principles for Encoding Proto-Cuneiform</esp:title>
  <html>
    <head/>
    <body>
      <p>This project is based on a subset of the CDLI corpus of
      Proto-Cuneiform texts from the Uruk IV and III periods and was
      created to support the development of a new iteration of the
      proposal to encode Proto-Cuneiform in Unicode.</p>

      <p>The corpus is restricted mainly to the published portion of
      the corpus--see <esp:link page="corpus">for more about the
      selection process.</esp:link>.</p>

      <p>The <esp:link page="reppc25">repertoire is available
      here</esp:link> and can be considered near-final.  There are
      several pages about how decisions were made on what should and
      should not be encoded.</p>

      <p>There is a <esp:link url="/pcsl/pc25/pager">text
      corpus</esp:link>; the signlist has not yet been enable for the
      corpus, but that is planned for the near future.</p>
