      <esp:sh>Signs with non-contrastive variants</esp:sh>

      <p>The 190 signs which have non-contrastive variants, with the
      proposed reference glyph in initial position in the list, is
      <esp:link page="repncv">given here</esp:link>.</p>

      <esp:sh>Numbers</esp:sh>

      <p>Although PC25 is primarily focussed on ideograms, <esp:link
      page="repnum">some numbers, listed here</esp:link>, need to be
      encoded to support N(N57) sequences.  This is a class of
      additions to AP24, which omitted all numbers.</p>

      <esp:sh>City Names</esp:sh>

      <p>A list of the signs which represent city names and are
      assigned codepoints rather than being treated as sequences is
      <esp:link page="repcity">given here</esp:link>.</p>
